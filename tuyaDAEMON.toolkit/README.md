## Installation ##
This **_Toolkit_** is developed in 'php' and you need a WEB server. I use [*xampp*](https://www.apachefriends.org/it/index.htm), a quick install bundle with *Apache, php, MariaDB, phpmyadmin* ), but you can use any *web server* with *php*.
 - Unzip the `tuyadaemon-toolkik.x.x.zip` file in `/htdocs` 
 - Import (using _phpmyadmin_) the `tuyadaemon-toolkik.x.x.sql` file to create the required DB `tuyathome`. You will found also some test data in db, after you can delete it.
 - Change (using _phpmyadmin_) the default value for field `'copynotice'` (table `'deviceinfos'`) with the actual year and your email.
