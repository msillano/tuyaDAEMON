# tuyaTRIGGER 

_A real device WiFI, having  a big unused numerical parameter, say a 'counter', writable for both **Tuya** and **node-red**, is all the required hardware to implement a robust bilateral event communication (**TRIGGER**)._

The 'counter' is used as a dual port register: a sender (_tuya-cloud/node-red_) set the counter to some XX value, the receiver gets the XX value, acts accordingly, and resets the counter to 0 (ACK action): the _node-red_ read/write actions are performed by **tuyaTRIGGER** flow, the _Tuya-cloud_ actions are performed by ad hoc automations, one for TRIGGER.


 - _node-red => tuya_: **node-red** write a predefined value in the 'counter' and that fires a specific **Tuya** automation: first the automation must reset the 'counter' to 0, then it can do anything.
 Tuya automation, say `trigger1010`:   _If "counter:1010" do "counter:0" and "any-action..."_ 

 - _tuya => node-red_: A tuya **scene** (user action) or **automation** (event) sets  a predefined value on the 'counter' (e.g. 2030), and when node-red read that, it must first reset  the "counter' to 0, then it can do anything.
 Tuya automation,  say `trigger2030`: _If "any-event" do "counter:2030"_ 

This **TRIGGER** mechanism, implemented in **tuyaTRIGGER**, allow a better _tuya <=> node-red_ integration in **tuyaDAEMON**:
 - _node-red_ can set/get status for _all devices and data point_ not found by `node-red-contrib-tuya-smart-device`.
 - _node-red_ can fire automation on _tuya-cloud_ 
 - _tuya scene_ can control _node-red flows_, so a node-red user can employ _smartlife_ as remote control (from anywhere).
 - _tuya automations_ can fire flows in _node-red_, implementing this way any control strategy not allowed by Tuya.
 - user can fire _node-red flows_ with vocal control (`Googlehome`)

###  system:_trgPing
An extestion of `_system` fake device is in tuyaTRIGGER, and manages the property `_trgPing`: i.e. a measure of the time consumed by a complete _TRIGGER round trip_:
  1) a `TRIGGER800` is sent by node-red
  2) The `tuya_bridge:counter` is set to 800 by node-red
  3) An automation is found and fired by _tuya-cloud_ "`if "tuya_bridge"countdown:800, "tuya_bridge"countdown:0`"
  4) `tuya_bridge:counter` is set to 0 by tuya-cloud 
  5) `TRIGGER0` is caught by _node-red_ and decoded.

On my PC I get the result (in ms):
````
_trgPing: object
    count: 5
      avg: 209
      max: 312
      min: 145

### Actual (example) triggers map in **tuyaTRIGGER** flow:

1) _TUYATRG (1000-1990) are used to handle 'mirror' devices._

   - the device changes status
   - an automation is fired by this event and it sends a TUYATRG to _node-red_.
   - on receiving the TUYATRG, _node-red_ remaps the trigger as a usual device message, to log them,  using a fake dps         (convention: same as the trigger value). The mirror device and dps must be defined in `global.alldevice.fake` branch.
   - _node-red_ sends an ACK (reset the 'counter' to 0)
   
    example in tuyaTRIGGER: 

    the WiFi '_Motion Detector_' device is battery powered. But a trigger is send at any status change by _tuya-cloud_ to _tuyaDAEMON_:

    - **TUYATRG1010**: is mapped as `Motion Detector [123410408caab8e79837]:alarm[dps:1010]:OFF`

      In Tuya Automation we need: _`If sensore di movimento:normale, tuya-bridge:countdown:1010`_ 

    - **TUYATRG1020**: is mapped as `Motion Detector [123410408caab8e79837]:alarm[dps:1010]:ON`

      In Tuya Automation we need: _`If "sensore di movimento:Allarme", tuya-bridge:countdown:1020`_ 

    See also ["siren mirror"](./../extra) extra flow.

2) _TUYATRG (1000-1990) are also used fired by_ smartlife _to signal some  user/device/weather/geolocation action_ 

    example in tuyaTRIGGER:

   - **TUYATRG1030**: free
   - **TUYATRG1040**: free

3) _REDTRG (2000-2990) can be fired by_ node-red, _to activate_ smartlife _automations:_  

    example in tuyaTRIGGER:
   - **REDTRG2010**: free
   - **REDTRG2020**: free

4) _more TRIGGERS, with conditions defined by the user, can fire node-red flows asynchronously, without `global.alldevices` polling, or implement conditions not allowed by_ smartlife _automatitions._

   example in tuyaTRIGGER:
   - **EVNTRIGGER00A**: fired if temperature > 20 Â°C  (from a virtual device)
   - **EVNTRIGGER00B**: fired on PIR alarm (from a mirror device)


### implementation

_This tick can be used with any device, named in the flow and in `alldevices` "tuya_bridge".

1) _I choose first the_ [Switch MS-104](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012114855.html) (USD 8) _because its countdown (`dp` = 102) is with a large range [0-86400s, i.e. 24H] and still the device can be used as a WiFi switch, because only the countdown function is used by this implementation, plus it is small and cheap. 

   The unique problem is the lack of a battery backup.

2) _Now I'm waiting for another device, a wifi switch_ [TYWR 7-32](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001292469801.html) (USD 10) _with a micro USB power input. When I get it I will update here after some tests_.

3) 'TuyaTrigger' value is placed in `msg.payload.tuyatrigger`.  The conversion `data.dp["102"] ==>  msg.payload.tuyatrigger` is done by `"dp converter"` change node. _To config your own `tuya-bridge` device, and to use any `dp`:_
     - modify the  `"dp converter"` change node. 
     - modify the code in `"red trigger"` sub-flow.


**note**
 
 - analog values can't be sent from tuya this way, because tuya does not allow the use of calculated values. But comparations are allowed: e.g. send trigger if `'temperature < 16'`. (Available: `<`; `=`; `>`). We can 'mirror' `BOOLEAN` dp (2 automations) `ENUM` dp: [0|1|2]  (3 automations) or also `INT`, but converted to ENUM when required: `{<15|16-20|21-25|26-30|31-35|36-40|>40}` but many automations are required (12 for this example).

 - using a countdown as a trigger, as _Switch MS-104_ does, requires REDTRG with numbers greater (e.g. 2000+) than TUYATRG (e.g. 1000..1999]): so, if _node-red_ is down, a Tuya TRIGGER not caught can't trigger a fake REDTRG.
 
 - If the used counter is a time counter (countdown in case of  _Switch MS-104_ ) you must choose trigger values at least separated by 10s, to allow the ACK action.

 - for fallback, MUST exist a Tuya Automation fired when the countdown is less than any trigger value (e.g. 800), to reset the countdown to 0 without ACK: so the countdown never interferes with the logic of the switch (this automation is also deployed by `_trgPing` implementation). Required automation:  `if "tuya_bridge"countdown:800, "tuya_bridge"countdown:0` 
 
- this implementation does not verify the ACKs presence and timing, and not uses any handshake strategy, so it is theoretically possible to have some interferences.
